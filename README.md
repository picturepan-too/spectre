## Preamble

This version of Spectre CSS has been forked from the [original repo](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre) owned by @picturepan, who did incredible work to bring this CSS framework to the web.

Unfortunately, work seems to have stopped on the codebase, with PRs dating back 5 or 6 years, and no communication from the author.

Without hard-feeling, this new fork has been created under a new organisation [spectre-org](https://github.com/spectre-org/) with the intention of:

- keeping the project alive
- merging outstanding pull requests
- publishing new releases
- potentially making future updates (such as [Spectre Vue](https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-vue))

A discussion about these aims has been started [here](https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-css/discussions/2), and you are encouraged to contribute!

Please see the checklist there and [issues](https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-css/issues) to keep up to date with progress.

## Browser support
Spectre uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make most styles compatible with earlier browsers and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for CSS resets. Spectre is designed for modern browsers. For best compatibility, these browsers are recommended:

- Chrome (LAST 4)
- Microsoft Edge (LAST 4)
- Firefox (EXTENDED SUPPORT RELEASE)
- Safari (LAST 4)
- Opera (LAST 4)
- Internet Explorer 10+

Spectre supports Internet Explorer 10+, but some HTML5 and CSS3 features are not perfectly supported by Internet Explorer.
